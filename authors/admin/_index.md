Hi, I am a senior student from the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) and [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). I major in Computer Engineering.

I am broadly interested in making computer systems reliable and secure. My mission is to help today’s systems defend against all kinds of errors and defects, such as software bugs and configuration errors.



One of my favorite topics is configuration management;
